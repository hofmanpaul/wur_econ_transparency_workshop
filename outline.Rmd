More and more academics are called upon to increase integrity in social science research. Is there a problem? If so what is it and why, and why should we care? This internal ECON workshop discusses key challenges related to research transparency, reproducibility and workflow. In addition, we will discuss the key tools that have been developed to help overcome these issues. 

The idea of the workshop is to have an interactive discussion around these issues. In preparation for the workshop think about what challenges you see for yourself and those around you. 

Looking forward to seeing you! 

Please do get in touch if you have any questions.
